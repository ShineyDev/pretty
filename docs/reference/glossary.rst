    pretty_hook.pth

        A hook file is installed into site-packages when you install pretty. It allows pretty to
        hook into all Python sessions, but will only do so if you set one or more of the above
        :term:`environment variables <PYTHONPRETTY>` to a :term:`truthy value <boolean value>`.
